// The start and end ranges
   const startRange = 1;
   const endRange = 100;

   
Create a for loop that iterates through the numbers within the range. Use the i variable as the loop counter:
   for (let i = startRange; i <= endRange; i++) {
     // Code to check if i is a prime number
   }
Inside the for loop, create a variable called isPrime and set it to true. This variable will be used to determine if the current number is a prime number.
   let isPrime = true;
Create a nested for loop that iterates through the numbers from 2 to the square root of the current number i. Use the j variable as the loop counter:
   for (let j = 2; j <= Math.sqrt(i); j++) {
     // Code to check if i is divisible by j
   }
Inside the nested for loop, check if the current number i is divisible by j. If it is, set isPrime to false and use the break statement to exit the loop:
   if (i % j === 0) {
     isPrime = false;
     break;
   }
After the nested for loop, check if the isPrime variable is still true. If it is, print the current number i to the console:
   if (isPrime) {
     console.log(i + " is a prime number.");
   }
When you run your program, it should display all prime numbers within the specified range in the console. By completing this practical challenge, youâ€™ll gain a better understanding of loops and control structures in JavaScript, which are fundamental concepts for any web developer.
